There's a strange bug happening with adding accounts where new accounts are sometimes (but not always) put in the wrong category. Not sure what is causing this.

Need to move lots of stuff out of MainActivity. This means moving to using DataCreator for the feed data, and implementing something similar for the account data.

Add full layout for Post. 

Implement post creation and add account screens.
